# Alarm Clock

A simple web application to help my wife and I get up in the morning.

## Installing and Running

1. Clone this repository
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `bundler install`
    * If there is a gem that isn't installing, you may be missing a package or two. Consult
    the log files to figure out what those things are.

## How can I help out?

I am not a Javascript programmer. I know just enough to get by. If you think you have
the chops to make it look/act a lot better than it does, feel free to fix it up!

If there is an issue or something you would want to add to the application, feel
free to throw that together too. Simply follow the following procedure:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Add test cases to the spec file
4. **Add test cases to the spec file**
5. Submit a pull request
